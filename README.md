⚙️ Features

Binary Addition: Adds two binary numbers.

Binary Subtraction: Subtracts one binary number from another.

Binary Multiplication: Multiplies two binary numbers.

Binary Division: Divides one binary number by another (integer division).

Input Validation: Ensures that inputs are valid binary numbers (only 0s and 1s).

User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for an interactive experience.
