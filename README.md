Project Overview

This project is a Binary Arithmetic Calculator designed to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on binary numbers.
It provides an interactive interface for users to input binary numbers and instantly get results in both binary and decimal formats.

> Goal: Help users understand and practice binary arithmetic while providing accurate calculations in a user-friendly environment.

Key Features

Interactive User Interface: Built with Streamlit for a smooth and modern user experience.

Binary Validation: Ensures only valid binary numbers (0 and 1) are accepted.

Multiple Operations: Supports Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.

Error Handling:

Division by zero is prevented.

Negative results in unsigned binary subtraction are flagged.


Dual Output: Shows result in binary and decimal simultaneously.

How It Works

1. Input: Users enter two binary numbers.


2. Validation: Checks that inputs contain only 0 and 1.


3. Operation Selection: User selects the arithmetic operation.


4. Calculation: Performs binary arithmetic and converts results to decimal.


5. Output: Displays binary result and decimal equivalent.
